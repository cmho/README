## General Notes

**Eye contact**

I'm a pretty friendly person but you may notice I don't hold eye contact for very long. Sometimes this gives people the wrong impression that I'm unhappy or that I don't like them, which is rarely true! I have an autism spectrum disorder and sustained eye contact, especially with people I'm not extremely close to, just makes me feel really uncomfortable. It's not you, it's me!

**What's the best way to get in touch with you?**

If we're work teammates, I am basically always on Slack and very responsive, but don't respond to messages in the evening or on weekends unless it's an emergency or I've pre-arranged to work outside standard hours. If I'm in the office, it's also 100% okay to swing by my desk--just shoot me a message first to double-check that I'm at a good stopping point (strong chance it'll be fine!), and also because I startle easily when people show up behind me.

## Questions for our [first 1:1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

**What pronouns do you use?**

[she/her](https://pronoun.is/she)

**What makes you grumpy?**

* vague or unclear requests without links or supporting screenshots :c
* being under 80% or over 105% capacity
* too many unplanned extra demands on my time
* being too cold in the office

**How will I know when you're grumpy?**

Warning signs include me skipping lunch or having a startle response any time anyone approaches my desk looking like they might ask me to do something.

**How can I help you when you're grumpy?**

Get me away from my desk or otherwise help me switch tracks for a bit. I'm usually pretty good at doing this on my own, but sometimes I can tunnel too hard on a problem and forget to do things that help me reset, like having a snack or taking a stretch break.

**How do you like to receive tasks? (Tickets, spreadsheets, slack messages, etc)**

If possible, I prefer to receive tasks in the form of tickets--it's easiest for me to keep track of the status that way. I also tend to write a lot of notes on how I approached a problem for later reference, so I prefer getting tickets in a place where I can add those!

**In what medium do you like to receive feedback?**

Slack messages are great for feedback that could use a little privacy; if I get a sudden mysterious meeting on my schedule or a manager wants to talk to me in private I tend to automatically go to worst-case scenario.

**At what times do you like feedback (routine in 1:1s, as-it-happens, etc)**

I prefer to get feedback as it happens, just so I can correct any problems as fast as possible--it feels better than hearing about something after the fact. If I hear about something for the first time at a review I feel like I've really screwed up!

**How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public/private)**

I love a spot of public recognition but I can get a little overwhelmed by it! If I look direly uncomfortable I am totally fine, I promise.

**What do you need from your manager?**

Reassurance that my work continues to be good (if applicable); direction on how to achieve goals that I've asked about, such as examples of how to demonstrate promotion qualities; help shifting around workload if it gets overwhelming.

**From your team?**

Feeling comfortable asking questions and being asked questions; being a sounding board for solving problems; help for areas outside my expertise; camaraderie.

**From your peers? (outside the team)**

Being able to ask questions and collaborate rather than receiving or giving orders or throwing something over the fence; exchanging ideas.

**What's your favorite baked good?**

I love all baked goods but I have a special soft spot for cake pops.
